"DrupalCon New Orleans
Sprint attendance - don't forget to also buy your ticket :)",,"IMPORTANT:
- Please provide your full name and drupal.org name (n.b. only sprint leader is in bold), and respond YES, NO or MAYBE, which will be automatically colored appropriately. 
- See the ""Notes"" column to the right to add notes to your response as applicable.
- Mark if you are available remotely in cases (not locally); knowing who is local vs. remote helps with budget/space planning.
- People who will lead a sprint topic can add their own topic. It is usually helpful to identify the lead and have them be the first person listed under the topic. Picking out a set of issues to focus on before the sprint and getting the issues ready (updating summaries, remaining tasks and tags) is helpful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
